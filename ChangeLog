    - Works towards DirectFB
   
2010-06-19  Version 0.7.1
   * xfreerdp: 
    - added -k option to force particular keyboard layout ID
    - added --kbd-list option to list all keyboard layout IDs
    - added -h option for help
    - changed -plugin and -data argument to --plugin and --data
   * Maintenance:
    - Fixes to build system

2010-06-11  Version 0.7.0
   * Software Architecture:
    - Full multi-session support
    - Created a library separate from the UI, making it easier to implement different UI's
    - New keyboard input system based on the XKB database, providing better support for international keyboards
    - Implemented Microsoft's virtual channel plugin API and re-implemented features as plugins (libfreerdpchanman)
    - Created a "device manager" for various devices redirected over the device redirection plugin
   * Refactoring:
    - X11 UI completely rewritten from scratch
    - Disk and printer redirection have been rewritten in a much cleaner way
    - redirection has been re-implemented as a virtual channel plugin
    - Sound redirection has also been re-implemented as a virtual channel plugin
    - A *LOT* of added comments in the code with regards to the protocol documentation
    - Cleanup and increased compliance with the documentation released by MS after rdesktop was created
   * Improvements:
    - Support for cursors on Windows Server 2008 R2
    - Support for bitmap caching, which provides a good performance boost
    - Build system has been completely revamped to use newer tools such as libtool
    - Support for Windows Server 2008 Terminal Services Session Broker Load Balancing
    - It is now possible to compile FreeRDP without OpenSSL, using built-in code (more lightweight on embedded systems but only partially supported)
    - Real capability set processing (original implementation discarded capability sets almost entirely and sent blobs)
   * Work In Progress:
    - A DirectFB UI has been started
    - New Win32 port with working native UI, but it's not complete yet
    - Support for NSS as a replacement for OpenSSL is also being worked on
    - Network Level Authentication is half-way done (TLS works, but NTLM authentication is partially implemented)
   * Dropped or Broken Features:
    - seamlessrdp is *NOT* supported. RemoteApp support is eventually going to replace seamlessrdp
    - Serial port redirection is currently not supported, as it needs to be re-implemented as a plugin
    - Smartcard support also needs to be re-implemented as a plugin
